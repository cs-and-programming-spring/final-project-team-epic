RowanRides is an application for university students to share rides with other students. This is not only for students to resquest a driver, but connect with other students from their university. The purpose is to foster relationships in an shared intimate space. Have real conversations while riding!

This program assigns a rider to a driver. If a rider is going to the same location as another student, it creates a match.
